	<h1>Prequil: Dante's inferno</h1>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Problem?</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3>You're just sitting around, it's nearly lunch, you're hungry</h3>
			<p>Someone knows you write some JavaScript, so they come over and need you to write something that lets you click on a thumbnail and make a larger picture.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>You search DuckDuckGo for something</h3>
			<p><a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+do+i+program+javascript%3F">DuckDuckGo</a> (even though it's awesome) ends up giving really confusing results, there's all sorts of answers, some work, some fail. You just don't know what to do. All the good resources look way too complex to get into. After hours of searching top-ten-lists of JavaScript plugins you find this really sweet plugin and try to put it into your code.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>It doesn't quite work</h3>
			<p>It's way too hard to figure out and you can't get the thing to work. But you're hungry and the pointy-haird guy wants it yesterday. You did see this one thing over on DynamicDrive and W3Schools about how to do something like that, so you try and copy it. It might not be as fancy as those plugins, but it sure does the job. In fact, it probably looks like this...</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Well look what you did! You're a hero!</h2>
			<pre><code>
&lt;script&gt;
  function runSomething1() {./*set an image to 1.jpg*/}
  function runSomething2() {./*set an image to 2.jpg*/}
  function runSomething3() {./*set an image to 3.jpg*/}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; onmouseover=&quot;javascript:runSomething1()&quot; style=&quot;hover{color:blue}&quot; /&gt;Image One&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; onmouseover=&quot;javascript:runSomething2()&quot; style=&quot;hover{color:blue}&quot; /&gt;Image Two&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; onmouseover=&quot;javascript:runSomething3()&quot; style=&quot;hover{color:blue}&quot;/&gt;Image Three&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Your pointy haired friend comes back thanking you up-and-down for the awesome job you did and how awesome it works. You're a hero, this must be what it's like to be a professional programmer.</p>
<p>As you gaze off into space, so proud, pointy-hair wonders if you could make a few minor changes to the thing... nothing huge of course.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Chapter one: the plot thickens.</h2>
	<blockquote>I want to add six more images and make every-other image link green, also the fourth image should show up when it loads.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<em>Love,<br/>
	Dr. Pointy-hair, PhD.</em>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So that's what you go off and do, expanding on your code from before. You add six more functions, go back, make five of the links blue <code>style="hover{color:blue}"</code>,  and stick a <code>onload="doSomething4()"</code> into the body tag. </p>
	<p>Wow, all this programming is hard work. Finally, after clicking around a bit everything looks like it's in working order. You tell the client they just have to change index2.html in their webserver to index.html, and it will be live. Just to be safe, make an index-bakJul42011.html.bak file so they have a copy of the old one.</p>
	<p>Another job well done!</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Well look what you did! You little jerk!</h2>
	<p>Pointy hair isn't happy, he renamed files like you said on his website and ran the page only to be faced with this friendly box:</p>
	<img src="./mise.gif" alt="JavaScript errors in Internet Explorer" />
	<p>Of course, you just explain to him he's on a really really old browser and he should upgrade because Internet Explorer is stupid and smells like old cheese also Fox fires are so 1337.</p>
	<p>Pointy hair kindly asks if you've lost your freaking mind. His customers use this browser. He paid you to make this work, so go and make it work. Other sites have stuff like this and it works fine in his browser. You're not getting paid till this works.</p>
	<h3>Finally, it works!</h3>
	<p>Hours and hours of hard work later you re-write the code twice and finally it works in the browser he uses. You just hope it works in other browsers as well. It's just a shame you ended up working for less than $10.00 per hour on this... Stupid IE.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>How was that vacation?</h2>
	<p>Hope you had fun. We needed changes while you were away but everyone said the code was just way too complex to figure out. Hope you can work it out. We want all those thumbnails to have a caption now. Better look at your code.</p>
	<pre><code>onclick=&quot;function _gjuc(){var b=_gjwl.href.indexOf(\&quot;#\&quot;);if(b&gt;=0){var a=_gjwl.href.substring(b+1);if(/(^|&amp;)q=/.test(a)&amp;&amp;a.indexOf(\&quot;#\&quot;)==-1&amp;&amp;!/(^|&amp;)cad=h($|&amp;)/.test(a)){_gjwl.replace(\&quot;/search?\&quot;+a.replace(/(^|&amp;)fp=[^&amp;]*/g,\&quot;\&quot;)+\&quot;&amp;cad=h\&quot;);return 1}}return 0;}&quot;</code></pre>
	<p>Uhhh, wait, you wrote this? What did it do? Ugh... Okay, maybe you should check out some blogs for a while and it will come back to you. Oh, this looks neat, <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/OnClick-Does-What!.aspx">TheDailyWTF</a>. A site that showcases bad code? </p>
	<pre><code>onclick=&quot;function _gjuc(){var b=_gjwl.href.indexOf(\&quot;#\&quot;);if(b&gt;=0){var a=_gjwl.href.substring(b+1);if(/(^|&amp;)q=/.test(a)&amp;&amp;a.indexOf(\&quot;#\&quot;)==-1&amp;&amp;!/(^|&amp;)cad=h($|&amp;)/.test(a)){_gjwl.replace(\&quot;/search?\&quot;+a.replace(/(^|&amp;)fp=[^&amp;]*/g,\&quot;\&quot;)+\&quot;&amp;cad=h\&quot;);return 1}}return 0;}&quot;</code></pre>
	<p>That's your code out there. Oh, that's not good. That's not good at all. Who sent this in? Was it one of the people they had look at my code? Why would they do this? This is so embarassing!</p>
	<p>But wait! They don't understand! It's totally out of context. This is top-notch programming! You wrote this yourself! You spent a long time learning how to write JavaScript this well, and it was really hard. They're just jealious. I'll show them, I'll make this code work fine. It'll only take you a few days... Better fire up dreamweaver.</p>

	<h2>It's not you, it's me. We had to hire someone else.</h2>
	<p>
	<strong>Lancey Howard:</strong> Gets down to what it's all about, doesn't it? Making the wrong move at the right time. <br/>
	<strong>Cincinnati Kid:</strong> Is that what it's all about? <br/>
	<strong>Lancey Howard:</strong> Like life, I guess. You're good, kid, but as long as I'm around you're second best. You might as well learn to live with it.	<br/>
	<br/>
	From <em>The Cincinnati Kid</em>, 1965.

	<img src="./Ckfilm.jpg" alt="JavaScript errors in Internet Explorer" />
	<hr/>
	<p>The cost of your code per hour is far below average, but the cost of keeping you around was too high. It's hard for the company to write new code around yours, and you take more than three-times as long as the new guy.</p>
	<p>How did he get to be such a hot shot? I looked at all the best sites like w3schools, I made multiple backups on the server clearly re-named, my code and styled were linked directly with every HTML element, my variable names didn't waste space, <strong>and</strong> I used the best browser out there.</p>

	<h2>Mission Impossible</h2>
	<h3>You have two options</h3>

		<li>
			<h4>Figure out how to write better JavaScript</h4>

	<h2>Extensions</h2>
	<p>Core gives you basic slide functionality with left and right arrow navigation, but you may want&nbsp;more. This deck includes all of them, so feel free to play around.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li class="slide" id="extensions-goto">
			<strong>deck.goto</strong>: Adds a shortcut key to jump to any slide number.  Hit g, type in the slide number, and hit&nbsp;enter.
		</li>
		
		<li class="slide" id="extensions-hash">
			<strong>deck.hash</strong>: Enables internal linking within slides, deep linking to individual slides, and updates the address bar &amp; a permalink anchor with each slide&nbsp;change.
		</li>

		<li class="slide" id="extensions-menu">
			<strong>deck.menu</strong>: Adds a menu view, letting you see all slides in a grid. Hit m to toggle to menu view, continue navigating your deck, and hit m to return to normal&nbsp;view.
		</li>

		<li class="slide" id="extensions-navigation">
			<strong>deck.navigation</strong>: Adds clickable left and right buttons for the less keyboard inclined.
		</li>

		<li class="slide" id="extensions-status">
			<strong>deck.status</strong>: Adds a page number indicator. (current/total)

  &lt;p&gt;Core gives you basic slide functionality...&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;li class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;deck.goto&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Adds a shortcut key to jump to any slide number...&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;	
     &lt;li class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
