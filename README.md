#Presentation on Writing Quality JavaScript

I'm writing a presentation that explains a lot of missing knowledge in new programmers, hobbiests, and even long-standing 
software authors that don't understand many things but are held back by a wall because knowledge isn't accessable,
and how tog et better isn't known to them, or appears too hard to be worth any rewards.


#Story Board/RoadMap

##Prequil: Dante's inferno.
- Show some bad code samples, stuff that's not DRY or logically seperated, etc.
- You're always over-time, over-budget
- You're constantly fixing crashes and can't figure out the bugs because you don't see them
- You're not sure how thigns work, or even where to go to start figureing out solutions
- It's all really confusing, no time to learn
- Maintainer will be a psycopath because of you
- I get all your business because your price may have been low, but the cost of your code was too high.

##Act one: How things work.
- Invent the internet.
- invent HTTP
- Invent HTML
- Invent JavaScript (and explain it can be run server-side). ecmascript, livescript, mocascript, jsscript, node...
- Invent the Window API, DOM API and XHR API

##Act two: This thing's bigger than just you and me
- Invent multiple browsers, and standards.
- Problems with one browser, not in others (crashes, renders, bugs, etc)
- Hack the planet (xss)
- Programming community: Good stuff, bad stuff. How to get help, peer review, docs, 
- Write code that we can actually share. This means clean code, variable names.
- No script.
- Population of the world online, vs next 10 years.

##Act Three: How to write clean code, not a mess.
- Logical variable names
- Documentation: Comments and docs
- Design patterns, abstractions (cut+paste+tweak DIES HERE)
- Hail the DOM events, the inline script tag is dead!
- Javascript: psudeo protocol doesn't work and is dead.

##Act four: How to write code that doesn't break
- Global needs to die.
- lint
- Unit tests
- SCM
- Peer review

##Act Five: How to write JavaScript that people love
- Fast (not slow)
- Events that don't suck
- DOM editing that doesn't suck
- Works everywhere, degrades gracefully.
- Copyright and licence are important.
- JS is prototypes, not classes. Stop doing that.

##Act six: Back to basics
- You're wrong, and that's awesome, because you know something now.
- You don't always need jQuery
- You don't need cut+paste+tweak, make DRY code.
- Don't abuse arrays/object differences, learn to loop, dare to dream. old Opera/FF, old MISE, sometimes Flash, 
- How decision structures can be used to your advantage, not add complexity to your code
- RTFM... specs, docs, etc.

##Act seven: Become a Samurai, not a code ninja.
- What's a Samurai? (Teaches everywhere, makes things, learns things, and a mighty force)
- What's a ninja? (Jumps in from the darkness, flips out and kills people, disapears)
- Learn to spot the bad code and the good code, find it in your own code.
- Create something, learn something, teach something.
- Broaden your horizons
- You're still wrong, even when you do know everything. Use a proof to be correct, not your status/authority.

##Epilogue
- Not sure what to put here, I need something that fills people with a good feeling for the future of all this work.
