#Presentation on Writing Quality JavaScript

This was built on deck.js because I saw it the other day and it looked all kinds of shiny and neat so I decided to plug it in.

I generally write a little bit each time someone sends me flying into a rage with awful code. Spooling missteaks are bound to be plentiful.

## Roadmap/Goals

#Goals to resolve

- There is an issue best described as "the blind leading the blind," where many JavaScript authors feel it's fine to write some of the worst code on the face of the earth. I would like to try and make an impact here.
- I need the work to be interesting, or these people too lazy to RTFM but not lazy enough to write code will lose interest.
- 
- 
- I want to create "future pull" in the work. 

#Roadmap

Honestly, I'm kicking ideas around right now...

- General kick in the face to bad code styles
- DRY code
- in-line doesn't exist anymore, don't use it, even once.
- javascript psudo-protocol is idiotic
- How to ask questions. How to tell if someone's smarter than you. How not to piss people off.
- design patterns
- layers of things. Maybe a light introduction to OSI layers, how HTTP works?
- Browsers, how they make it work and why you make them cry
- No, jQuery isn't the answer, it's a tool, one tool. Everything is not a nail, stop hitting them like they are.
- events. Bind them, delegate them, but don't be an idiot
- Loops, switches, boolean
- Static code analysis tools
- Documentation
- How to name variables
- DOM
- unit tests
- SCM
-
