#Presentation on Writing Quality JavaScript

This was built on deck.js because I saw it the other day and it looked all kinds of shiny and neat so I decided to plug it in.

I generally write a little bit each time someone sends me flying into a rage with awful code. Spooling missteaks are bound to be plentiful.

I built this on a project called Deck.js. You can find it on GitHub.

# Roadmap/Goals

##Goals to resolve

- There is an issue best described as "the blind leading the blind," where many JavaScript authors feel it's fine to write some of the worst code on the face of the earth. I would like to try and make an impact here.
- I need the work to be interesting, or these people too lazy to RTFM but not lazy enough to write code will lose interest.
- I want to create "future pull" in the work. 

Honestly, I'm kicking ideas around right now...


- General kick in the face to bad code styles:
- - In-line doesn't exist anymore, don't use it, even once.
- - javascript psudo-protocol is idiotic
- - Stop doing cut+paste+tweak


- Don't suck at:
- - Loops
- - Decision structures
- - Arrays/objects
- - Events (should I cover dom first?)
- - Prototypal objects (has own porpery and truthy things)
- - One trick pony and jQuery.
- - Pretending javascript is something it's not and bitching about it later when it turns out it isn't. 
- - Noscript? (I hate this one)
- - h4x0rz


- Good/Best practices:
- - DRY code
- - design patterns
- - Documentation
- - How to name variables
- - What the hell a function and an object is


- Knowledge you should have:
- - layers of things. Maybe an overview of the OSI and HTTP?
- - unit tests
- - SCM
- - Static code analysis tools
- - DOM
- - Explain what jQuery is, explain there's life outside of it, explain it's bad
- - jsperf?
- - Browsers, how they make it work and why you make them cry


- Community:
- - How to ask questions. How to tell if someone's smarter than you. How not to piss people off.
- - Good sites (mdc, js garden w3c ...)
- - BAD sites (lookin' at you dynamic drive, javascriptkit, and w3schools.)


##Roadmap

Introduction to who the person is, some guy at a job. Or a student. I'd like to cross the broundy here somehow.

Take them through a problem they have to solve, or multiple ones. Take them through what they did (the bad solution).

Bad thigns you do:

1. cut+paste+tweak
1. in-line styles and JS
1. Psudo-protocol
1. Abuse of arrays/objects
1. loops abuse
1. control structures (lots of ifs, no idea what switch is, or something...)
1. Events everywhere on everything all the time
1. Noscript? No service.
1. Try to write the thing like it's a class.
1. global global global
1. ignore licences/copyrights
1. jQuery all the things!!!!111
1. We don't need no stinkin' comments
1. Variables that are just a few letters, or named stupidly

Smart things you don't do:

1. No SCM
1. No docs
1. no linting
1. no design patterns
1. no peer review
1. w3fools
1. Don't bother with reading specs
1. Ask for help when you need it
1. Don't know when you need help

Bad things that happen:

1. h4x/xss
1. slow
1. crashes in some browsers, not others
1. crashes in random situations but you can't figure it out so it doesn't exist
1. Nobody wants to help you

Things you need to learn:

1. OSI/HTTP
1. DOM
1. How browsers work
1. unit tests
1. spotting good code, spotting bad code




... now to figure out a story-board?
